# Talko-Lingo
A demonstration project for the re:Invent Builder's Fair

## Abstract

### Talko-Lingo: The multilingual Talkie-Walkie

Talko-Lingo is a simple demonstration project that leverages several AWS technologies to enable multilingual communications. It presents itself as a twenty-first century "Talkie-Walkie" that can translate communications as they happen. Based on a simple Raspberry Pi, this open-source project will introduce attendees to how AWS cloud technologies used to bring life to Internet of Things projects, with a touch of 3D printing and electronics design. Attendees will also be able to try it by themselves and test the technology, with visual feedback and additional informations regarding the whole translation process.

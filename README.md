# Talko-Lingo
A demonstration project for the re:Invent Builder's Fair

## Abstract

### Talko-Lingo: The multilingual Walkie Talkie

Talko-Lingo enables near real-time communication between two people of the same
or different languages. Users interface with a Walkie Talkie consisting of a
Raspberry Pi embedded into a 3D printed device. After selecting their language,
each user can seamlessly communicate with the recipient, who may be speaking a
different language. The project leverages AWS cloud technologies to encode each
user's voice, transcribe it, translate it to the target language and then
finally convert the translated text to speech. Built-in display mechanisms
provide visual feedback of the translation process.

### Project setup

In order to complete your own Talko-Lingo Walkie-Talkie, we did put together
a step-by-step tutorial to get you going. Note that these are only suggestions
and we encourage you to make you own version of these.

1. [Cloud resources Setup](README_CLOUD_RESOURCES.md)
2. [Raspberry Pi Software Setup](README_RASPBERRY_PI.md)
3. [Raspberry Pi Hardware Setup](README_HARDWARE.md)
4. [Case 3D Printing](README_3D_PRINTING.md)

If all is going well, you should have a fully-functional Walkie-Talkie setup! As a bonus, you can tweak it to work over WiFi and communicate over hundreds of kilometers :-)

## Required hardware

In order to complete this project, you will need two copies of each of those things:

1. **Adafruit's Speaker Bonnet**: An I2S stereo amplifier for the Raspberry Pi. It connects directly to the GPIO and exposes most useful pins. *Warning*: It makes use of pins **19** and **21** even if they are re-exposed. Do not use them if you intend to play sound at the same time.
2. **Adafruit's 3W 4Ohm Speakers**: The speakers normally coming with the bonnet aforementioned.
3. **Adafruit's 16mm Illuminated Pushbutton**: A simple push button equipped with a 3V LED light.
4. **A Raspberry Pi 3**: We made our tests using a Raspberry Pi model B, but a model A, B+ or A+ should work just as well...
5. **Adafruit's Mini USB Microphone**: A very simple microphone. Be careful, from what we have tested, the quality can be inconsistent...
6. **Adafruit's Mini 8-Way Rotary Selector Switch**: We chose an 8-position rotary switch, but a rotary encoder could be a superior choice.
7. **Adafruit's Potentiometer Knob**: Just to put on the previously mentioned Rotary Selector so that it looks *sexier*.
8. **Adafruit's Alphanumeric Display with its I2C Backpack**: Adafruit has a really easy-to-use LED alphanumeric display, including very well detailed tutorial for Raspberry Pi..
9. **A flat ribbon cable**: We chose to use a rainbow-colored flat ribbon for ease of use, but really anything you have on-hand will do the job ;-)
